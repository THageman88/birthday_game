# Birthday Game README

This is the Birthday Game. In this game you are asked to reflect on your last year of life and answer questions about it. The purpose of this game is purely for entertainment. I was introduced to this game a few years ago by my girlfriend. The questions she asked seemed to vary every year, but the haooiness and sentiment from playing the Birthday Game never fades.
